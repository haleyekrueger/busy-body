Having issues with github on my computer so I'm sure there was a better way to push all of this. All of these files need to be under an "app" folder once the commands below are run. React native is going to look for app/index.js to start the app. Going to keep working on this and hopefully fix these issues soon!

to create app enter in the command line:

npx create-react-native-app -t with-router

npm start
