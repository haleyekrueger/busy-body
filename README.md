# busy-body


Accidentally did a force push and deleted previous commits including the original README.
Does not look like there is a way to get those commits back. Reminder: don't put -f flag next
to push!!!

Keeping this here for future reference :
  git init
  git branch some_new_branch
  git checkout some_new_branch
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m "some really cool commit message"
  git remote add "https://github.com/haleyekrueger/busy-body.git"
  git push -u origin some_new_branch
  
  Then go on github and merge :) 
  
  

To run file:

npm install
npm run ios
OR
npm run android
OR
npm run web
